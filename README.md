Inspired by @simonw  attempting to retain everything I learn. The method will be to write down what I learn, what questions I have and a summary of what was learned. <del>Based on a blogpost https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/</del> -- I find this to combersome, but will use tidbits.




### TODO

* Use github actions to check in a summary change
* Refactor to use a common format
* Look at HUGO to generate github page content
* Make this a habbit
