# Stress Management for Engineers


1. *Document Everything* - Keep a record of what you have done, said, and
   directed
1. *Handle the important stuff immediately* - Create a daily list and a list for
   tomorrow at the end of the day or early morning
1. *Follow-up on everything* - people will get distracted
1. *Double Check your work* - "measure twice cut once"
1. *Test everything* - PASSING tests automatically speeds up this process
1. Self-Care - Eat on a schedule, exercise
